              In 1945, a German U-boat sank due to a toilet malfunction. The sub was fitted with a new deep water high-pressure toilet system which allowed them to be used while running at depth. Flushing these facilities was extremely complicated and special technicians were trained to operate them.

              The Swedish warship Vasa, which famously sank in 1628 less than a mile into its maiden voyage, was built asymmetrically. Archaeologists have found four rulers used by the workers; two turned out to be based on Swedish feet with 12 inches. The other two used Amsterdam feet, with 11 inches.

            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">In 1987, Mel Fisher discovered the shipwreck of the Nuestra Senora de Atocha. The galleon was sailing from the new world to Spain; however, it was struck by a hurricane and sank in 1622. Consequently, 260 people lost their lives while 5 survivors remained. The ship contained 40 tons of gold and silver with around 70 pounds of Colombian emeralds of the finest quality, which made it so special. On July 20, 1985, Mel Fisher discovered the shipwreck off the Florida Keys where the Treasure Galleon's value is estimated to be worth an astounding $400 million. In addition, other items with great historical importance were recovered. As a result, it was declared the most valuable shipwreck in the world by the Guinness world record.</h3>

            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Hi Mike, 
              <br><br>Do you remember our childhood dream to find a shipwreck by ourselves? Well guess what, I set my mind on finding a new shipwreck, and exploring it all by myself!
              <br><br>I am currently trying to find the Santa Maria since there were tons of valuables on it. The Santa Maria left Spain in August 1492, along with two other ships, sailing westward. It was the largest ship in the expedition, about 117ft long. The ship ran aground on a reef near Haiti on Christmas Day, 1492 and has never been found since.
              <br><br>Your recent exploration of The Black Swan really inspired me to start searching for shipwrecks myself. Moreover, the fact that you explored it professionally without getting hurt and finding almost all the valuables really got to me. Your insane!
              <br><br>I am extremely excited to start sailing off to search for it because I’ve heard that the Santa Maria is worth over $650 million. Isn’t that just crazy? I am also really excited to explore it as it will be my first shipwreck exploration, a worthy one at that.
              <br><br>Anyway, I’ll keep you updated on my progress, and I hope you can give me some tips.

            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">We decided to make a Remotely Operated Drone (ROD) to help us explore shipwrecks, which is based of an ROV; however, it is safer and very reliable because of the new technology we have implemented in it. The ROD is equipped with lights and video cameras so we can view the shipwreck clearly. Moreover, it is smaller than humans so it can fit through tighter spaces. Additionally, it is launched and controlled from a research vessel positioned above the shipwreck. Therfore, we can use the video transmitted to determine the age, characteristics, and possible identity of the ship wreck.<br><br>
              Plastics such as HDPE, Acrylic, Polycarbonate, and Nylon are good materials to build the ROD with as they are durable, have a neutral buoyancy (Increases energy efficiency), and are suitable for a marine environment.<br><br>

            <h3 class="machine-subheading-big">ROVs have main 6 main components:<br><br></h3>

            <h3 class="machine-subheading-small">Thrusters</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">The thrusters are electrically or hydraulically powered propellers used to maneuver the vehicle. There are almost always multiple thrusters to provide movement in multiple directions.<br><br></h3>

            <h3 class="machine-subheading-small">Camera</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Since the vehicle travels deep underwater, the only view that the pilot has is through the onboard camera, which must be able to provide an image with low-latency.<br><br></h3>
            
            <h3 class="machine-subheading-small">Lights</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">The lights provide illumination for the camera underwater. Sunlight disappears rapidly underwater and many ROV missions occur at depths that are normally in complete darkness.<br><br></h3>

            <h3 class="machine-subheading-small">Tether</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Nearly all ROVs have a tether that carries electrical power and/or signals to the surface so that the pilot can control the vehicle and see the camera. Radio waves don’t travel far through water, so it’s not possible to operate an ROV with modern wireless technology. There are acoustic and optical modem technologies that may someday enable wireless operation.<br><br></h3>

            <h3 class="machine-subheading-small">Frame</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">The frame provides a structure to attach the thrusters, camera, lights, tether, and other components of the ROV. Most ROVs are built with an open rectangular frame that makes it easy to build and modify, but some ROVs are built with highly specialized frames to reduce drag, improve appearance, or perform a special mission.<br><br></h3>

            <h3 class="machine-subheading-small">Pilot Controls</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">The surface controls can range from something that looks like the control room for a spaceship to something as simple as a smartphone. In any case, the surface controls provide a physical interface for the pilot to control the vehicle and a display of feedback from the vehicle including the camera view.<br><br></h3>

            <h3 class="machine-subheading-small">Claws</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Claws are used to maneuver objects around to help the ROV move around easily.<br><br></h3>
