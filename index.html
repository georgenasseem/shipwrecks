            Report
          </h2>
        </div>
          <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Introduction:<br>
            Recently, our teacher asked us to write a report about a very valuable shipwreck and explain the benefits of the shipwreck and also describe how it can be improved later on.<br><br>
              
            Findings:<br>
            35 years ago, Mel Fisher discovered the shipwreck of Nuestra Senora de Atocha off the Florida Keys. It was filled with 40 tons of gold and silver. In addition, with 70 pounds of Colombian emeralds. However, Spanish salvors tried and yet still failed to recover this cargo. Moreover, it was because the hatches were very strung out. On top of that, the shipwreck was destroyed later on from the second hurricane and was lost without trace. The cargo’s value is estimated to be worth around $400 million. This is why it was declared the most valuable shipwreck in the world by the Guinness world record in 2014. <br><br>
              
            Recommendation:<br>
            The Spanish salvors failed to recover the cargo because they didn’t have the tools to unlock the hatch. I would suggest that next time they bring tools so they can get the cargo without trying inflexibly to try and unlock it.<br><br>

            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">We decided to make a Remotely Operated Drone (ROD) to help us explore shipwrecks, which is based of an ROV; however, it is safer and very reliable because of the new technology we have implemented in it. The ROD is equipped with lights and video cameras so we can view the shipwreck clearly. Moreover, it is smaller than humans so it can fit through tighter spaces. Additionally, it is launched and controlled from a research vessel positioned above the shipwreck. Therfore, we can use the video transmitted to determine the age, characteristics, and possible identity of the ship wreck.<br><br>
              Plastics such as HDPE, Acrylic, Polycarbonate, and Nylon are good materials to build the ROD with as they are durable, have a neutral buoyancy (Increases energy efficiency), and are suitable for a marine environment.<br><br>

            <h3 class="machine-subheading-big">ROVs have main 6 main components:<br><br></h3>

            <h3 class="machine-subheading-small">Thrusters</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">The thrusters are electrically or hydraulically powered propellers used to maneuver the vehicle. There are almost always multiple thrusters to provide movement in multiple directions.<br><br></h3>

            <h3 class="machine-subheading-small">Camera</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Since the vehicle travels deep underwater, the only view that the pilot has is through the onboard camera, which must be able to provide an image with low-latency.<br><br></h3>
            
            <h3 class="machine-subheading-small">Lights</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">The lights provide illumination for the camera underwater. Sunlight disappears rapidly underwater and many ROV missions occur at depths that are normally in complete darkness.<br><br></h3>

            <h3 class="machine-subheading-small">Tether</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Nearly all ROVs have a tether that carries electrical power and/or signals to the surface so that the pilot can control the vehicle and see the camera. Radio waves don’t travel far through water, so it’s not possible to operate an ROV with modern wireless technology. There are acoustic and optical modem technologies that may someday enable wireless operation.<br><br></h3>

            <h3 class="machine-subheading-small">Frame</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">The frame provides a structure to attach the thrusters, camera, lights, tether, and other components of the ROV. Most ROVs are built with an open rectangular frame that makes it easy to build and modify, but some ROVs are built with highly specialized frames to reduce drag, improve appearance, or perform a special mission.<br><br></h3>

            <h3 class="machine-subheading-small">Pilot Controls</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">The surface controls can range from something that looks like the control room for a spaceship to something as simple as a smartphone. In any case, the surface controls provide a physical interface for the pilot to control the vehicle and a display of feedback from the vehicle including the camera view.<br><br></h3>

            <h3 class="machine-subheading-small">Claws</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Claws are used to maneuver objects around to help the ROV move around easily.<br><br></h3>
